skpcp
===========

SkPCP: a package for robust principal component analysis or *principal component pursuit*
built on top of `RobustPCA <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1970392.1970395/>`

- The basic idea is to decompose a data matrix D into a low-rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S, i.e., D = L + S.
- Principal component pursuit aims at recovering L and S by solving the convex optimization problem:

  min $||L||_* + Î»||S||_1$ subject to $D = L + S$, where the parameter $\lambda > 0$ 
  is a regularization parameter that balances the trade-off between the rank and sparsity.
